Welcome to Audiometry Made Easy!

This project was originally created for the Engineering World Health 2014 Design Competition, which 
is a competition focused on designing novel solutions to issues in the medical world of developing
countries. Engineering World Health is an awesome organization, and you can find out more about them
at wwww.ewh.org. I went with EWH to Rwanda in the summer of 2014 for two months to work in local hospitals,
fix stuff, and see these problems for myself-- if you want to learn more about that, check out my blog at
reecestevens.svbtle.com.
